STATSketball
============

This is my senior capstone project for Loyola Marymount Universty CMSI402 Spring 2014.


##What Is It

STATSketball is a web based stat keeping software for basketball games. This is designed so that amatuer users can record basketball stats, generate advanced basketball statistics, and generate reports of the statistics with visualizations and clearly displayed data. 

##Installation

I find using Homebrew easy to install certain packages. You can install homebrew by typing this in your command line. You may need to do a sudo install.

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
brew update
```

###1. Install Node

```bash
sudo brew install node
```

###2. Install meteor

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

###3. Phonegap instructions coming soon

##Running the application

In the project directory on the command line, enter the following 

```bash
cd STATSketball | meteor
```
