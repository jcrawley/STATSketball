STATSketball
============

This is my senior capstone project for Loyola Marymount Universty CMSI402 Spring 2014.


##What Is It

STATSketball is a web based stat keeping software for basketball games. This is designed so that amatuer users can record basketball stats, generate advanced basketball statistics, and generate reports of the statistics with visualizations and clearly displayed data. 

##Running the application

This is currently a concept, implementation to come.
